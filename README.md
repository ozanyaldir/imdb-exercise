Swift iOS Application

# imdb-exercise

  An exercise project that searches data from an API, lists results and shows item details.

  Note: In an early stage has few unit tests, very basic UI, lacking core features and no integration or automated UI tests. Just to give an idea about my approach.
  
  Note2: Lacking mock generator and mock use cases in tests. Requires changes for better dendency-injection (espacially api service)
